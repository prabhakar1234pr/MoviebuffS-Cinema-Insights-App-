Movie Buffs Application:
Project Overview:
The Movie Buffs application is designed for movie enthusiasts and migrants, allowing users to shape movie selections at local theaters through voting, commenting, and sharing their preferences. Theater owners can use the platform to understand audience preferences, improving their movie selections to cater to community tastes.

The application offers users the ability to vote for movies they want to see, interact with others through comments, and view curated movie listings based on the most popular choices. Theaters can analyze user input to make informed decisions about screenings.

Features:
Voting System: Users vote on movies, with votes determining which films are prioritized for screening.
User Feedback: Users can comment on movies and interact with other community members.
Analytics for Theaters: Theater owners get detailed analytics to help them decide which movies to screen based on user preferences.
Business Model: The app uses a "Free with Ads" model, generating revenue through advertisements.
User Personas:
Maria: A migrant community connector, she engages with the app to ensure her community's movie preferences are heard and represented.
David: A movie enthusiast who actively votes and engages with comments on the app to influence local theater selections.
Sarah: A theater owner who uses the app to make data-driven decisions about which movies to show.
Sam: A snack stand owner who uses insights from the app to align his inventory with the upcoming movies.
Database Design:
The app's database consists of 7 main tables:

Movie_Table: Stores movie details such as name, genre, and language.
User_Table: Stores user details like name and email.
Theater_ID: Contains theater information such as location and capacity.
Comments_Table: Stores user comments on movies, linked by User_ID and Movie_ID.
Vote_Table: Stores user votes for movies, linked by User_ID and Movie_ID.
Vote_count_Table: Stores the number of votes each movie receives weekly.
Theater_screenings_Table: Stores data on which theaters are screening which movies.
Database Relationships:
One user can vote on multiple movies.
One movie can receive multiple votes.
One movie has a unique vote count each week.
A theater can screen multiple movies, and each movie can be screened at multiple theaters.
Example SQL Queries:
Query 1: Joining Movie, Vote Count, and Screenings Tables
sql
code:
SELECT * FROM Movie_Table
JOIN Vote_count_Table ON Movie_Table.Movie_ID = Vote_count_Table.Movie_ID
JOIN Theater_screenings_Table ON Movie_Table.Movie_ID = Theater_screenings_Table.Movie_ID;
Query 2: Retrieve Votes by a Specific User
sql
code:
SELECT * FROM User_Table
JOIN Vote_Table ON User_Table.User_ID = Vote_Table.User_ID
JOIN Movie_Table ON Vote_Table.Movie_ID = Movie_Table.Movie_ID
WHERE User_Table.User_ID = 100;
Security Concerns:
Security is paramount for this app. Key areas of concern include:

Authentication & Authorization: Proper user validation is needed.
Data Protection: Encryption for data transmission and storage.
Input Validation: Preventing injection attacks and securing user inputs.
Session Management: Ensuring safe and secure user sessions.
Mitigations include strong authentication mechanisms, encryption, and regular security testing.

Server Architecture:
For scalability and performance, a cloud-based infrastructure using services such as AWS or Microsoft Azure is recommended. A combination of virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions will allow the system to efficiently handle user requests and scale according to demand.

Future Considerations:
User Authentication: Developing login and user authentication features.
Enhanced Analytics: Offering more detailed insights for theaters.
Freemium Model: Exploring a subscription-based model for ad-free experiences or premium analytics.
Data Scalability: Ensuring the app can handle large volumes of user data as it grows.
